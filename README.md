# Py4Math

## Project Description
This module is extensively designed for non-math coders and beginners. The user need not know math to solve complex math problems; this module does it all for you. The most special feature of this module is its `search()` function. Now, just search your query after importing the module, and it will be resolved. This module consists of over 50+ math formulas and is still developing.

## Syntax

```python
import py4math

py4math.search(<Type your problem here>)
```

### Examples

```python
py4math.search('area of triangle')
```
